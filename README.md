## How to use
DataTool is a command line application which means you need to know how to use a command line.

0. Make sure Overwatch is installed.
1. Download the latest release from our Discord
2. Extract the all the files to a folder, do not put it in your Overwatch Directory.
3. Open a command line in the folder where you extracted the files.
4. Run DataTool.exe via command line for a list of help and supported commands.

Most commands follow the structure `DataTool.exe <overwatch_directory> <mode> [mode args]`

### Blender Addon
In order to import skins or maps into Blender extracted by the tool, you will need to install our blender addon: https://github.com/overtools/io_scene_owm<br>
Releases and updates for the addon are also posted on our Discord linked above.<br>
**Blender 3.5 or above is required.**

### Example List Commands
```
DataTool.exe "C:\Games\Overwatch" list-heroes
DataTool.exe "C:\Games\Overwatch" list-unlocks
DataTool.exe "C:\Games\Overwatch" list-maps
DataTool.exe "C:\Games\Overwatch" list-achievements
```

#### JSON output
Many of the list commands support JSON output.<br>
To do this you must provide the `--json` flag as well as an `--output` flag to specify where to save the JSON file.<br>
Example:
```
DataTool.exe "C:\Games\Overwatch" list-heroes --json --output "C:\Games\Extracts\Heroes.json"
```

### Example Extract Commands

Some of the more common extract commands include:
 * extract-unlocks - extract all hero unlocks such as skins, highlight intros, emotes, sprays, icons
 * extract-general - handles extracting all class unlocks such as all class sprays and icons and portraits
 * extract-maps - extract maps
 * extract-hero-voice - extracts all heroes voicelines and groups them by type (kinda)
 * extract-conversations - extracts all hero conversations

In most cases when using extract commands, you must provide the name of what you want to extract or use `*` for everything.<br>
See below for some examples.

#### Example Commands
```
Tracers Overwatch 1 Skin (You can enter the name of any skin):
DataTool.exe "C:\Games\Overwatch" extract-unlocks "C:\Games\Extracts" "Tracer|skin=Overwatch 1"

All Heroes Overwatch 1 Skins:
DataTool.exe "C:\Games\Overwatch" extract-unlocks "C:\Games\Extracts" "*|skin=Overwatch 1"

All Heroes Skins (will take long time):
DataTool.exe "C:\Games\Overwatch" extract-unlocks "C:\Games\Extracts" "*|skin=*"

Everything - includes skins, emotes, highlight intros, etc. (will take very long time)
DataTool.exe "C:\Games\Overwatch" extract-unlocks "C:\Games\Extracts" *

Extract Dorado map
DataTool.exe "C:\Games\Overwatch" extract-maps "C:\Games\Extracts" "Dorado"

Extract All Maps (will take a long time)
DataTool.exe "C:\Games\Overwatch" extract-maps "C:\Games\Extracts" *

Extract Tracers Voicelines
DataTool.exe "C:\Games\Overwatch" extract-hero-voice "C:\Games\Extracts" Tracer

Extract Tracers Conversations
DataTool.exe "C:\Games\Overwatch" extract-conversations "C:\Games\Extracts" Tracer
```

#### Extract Unlocks filters
The extract unlocks command supports extracting a lot of data and you can filter to specifically what you want.<br>
The command structure looks like: `DataTool.exe <overwatch_directory> extract-unlocks <output_directory> [filters]`<br>
Filters follow the format `{hero name}|{type}={item name}`. You can specify `*` for the hero name or the type for everything.<br>
Valid types include: skin, icon, spray, victorypose, emote, voiceline

#### Example Filters
```
"*"                                   // Everything (all heroes skins, sprays, etc) (very slow)
"*|skin=*"                            // All Heroes Skins
"Tracer|skin=Overwatch 1"             // Tracers Overwatch 1 skin
"Reaper|spray=*"                      // Reaper's sprays
"Reaper|voiceline=*"                  // Reapers unlockable voicelines
```

### Tool Flags
There is also a variety of flags you can use that can change how some of the extract commands work.
```
--subtitles-with-sounds - Extracts subtitles in txt files next to the audio files (default false)
--voice-group-by-hero - When extracting voicelines, groups them by the hero (default true)
